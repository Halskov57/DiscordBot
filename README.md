# DiscordBot

A simple discord bot that tracks emote usage of users in a server.
Offers visualization of most used emotes and user specific emote usage, through the use of custom slash commands.

Built with a very maintainable structure in mind so its easy to add features ontop.
The core libraries of choice is the discordGo API wrapper library in order to stay true to the API documentation and avoid fully built frameworks.
MongoDb was chosen as the main database, but it would be very simple to perform a database migration due to the dependency injection pattern chosen.
